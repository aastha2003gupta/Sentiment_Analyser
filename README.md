# Sentiment_Analyser
**Objective:**
The aim is to conduct sentiment analysis on textual data using two different approachesâ€”NLTK with VADER and Hugging Face Transformers with RoBERTa. Additionally, a pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline is employed for comparison.

**Implementation:**

NLTK (VADER):

The NLTK library, specifically VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), is used for sentiment analysis.
VADER provides sentiment scores for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
Hugging Face Transformers (RoBERTa):

The Hugging Face Transformers library is utilized to implement sentiment analysis with the RoBERTa model.
RoBERTa provides sentiment scores categorized as negative, neutral, and positive.
Visualizations:

Seaborn pair plots are generated to visualize relationships between sentiment scores from both NLTK and RoBERTa.
The plots offer insights into how sentiment scores from different models correlate and differ.
Transformers Pipeline:

A pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline from Hugging Face Transformers is incorporated for streamlined sentiment analysis.
